## Description

_Allows you to check USD currency exchange rate_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _requires NPM_

_Instructions_: using terminal, navigate to the directory you would like to download this directory to. For this example we will be navigating to desktop. For any commands, type what is in between the 'single' quotation marks. To navigate to desktop, type 'cd ~/desktop'. To confirm your location enter 'pwd'. You should receive a message similar to "/c/Users/vampi/desktop" in this instance my location translates to "/hard drive c/Users folder/user/desktop". The last entry "desktop" is my current directory, and just happens to be inside of the other directories previously listed.

**Note: If you have a directory named programmingLanguageSuggester located here before using this next command, you may run into issues. To see a list of directories in your current location enter 'ls' in the terminal.**

Next, enter the following command 'git clone https://github.com/MorganJBradford/currency-exchange-rate.git'

The terminal should return with something similar to:

Next enter the command 'ls' which should return with a list of files and directories. Mine returned with:

desktop.ini icebreaker/ portfolio/ currency-exchange-rate/

Because I did not have a directory named currency-exchange-rate, I know it downloaded successfully.

Next enter the directory with the command 'cd currency-exchange-rate'. To confirm your location, enter 'pwd'. I received the following message "/c/Users/vampi/OneDrive/Desktop/epicodus/projects/SGA-Calculator". Once your location is confirmed, enter 'npm install'. You may see a similar message to the following:

The warning are related to newer software being available, and should not prevent the application from running.

Next, enter 'npm run start'. The will run a development server in your default web browser.
